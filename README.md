## 🧱 Tech Stack Overview

This project uses a MERN-like architecture combining:

- **Back-end:**
  - Node.js runtime environment
  - Express.js web framework for building the API server
  - MongoDB as the database
  - Mongoose as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB
  - CORS middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
  - Nodemon for development to automatically restart the server on code changes

- **Front-end:**
  - React.js library for building the user interface
  - Create React App as the front-end build and development toolchain
  - JavaScript (ES6+), CSS for styling
  - React components organized under the `src/Components` directory
  - React Context API for state management (`BsContext` and `BsState`)

- **Additional:**
  - The back-end server listens on port 8080 and connects to a local MongoDB instance.
  - The front-end development server runs on port 3000.
  - This full stack setup uses a MERN-like architecture (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
